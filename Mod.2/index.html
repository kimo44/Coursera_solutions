			 <p>This is an example of a sub-genre that has grown enough to become its own genre. In fact, because of the prevalence of these games, many people use the term "shooter" to refer to first-person-shooters. These games are realtime fast-paced action games in which the player navigates an environment from a first-person perspective</p>

			 <h2 class="RPGs">RPGs</h2>
			 <p>Role Playing Games: Evolving from pen-and-paper games like Dungeons and Dragons, RPGs are a special type of adventure game that usually incorporate three major elements: 1) a specific quest, 2) a process for evolving a character through experience to improve his/her ability to handle deadlier foes, 3) the careful acquisition and management if inventory items for the quest.</p>

			<p>Another of the first video game genres, especially from the computer platforms, was the adventure game. These were initially text-based games like Will Crowther's Collossal Cave and the original Zork games. However, as the power of the gaming systems grew, developers tried to tap into the visual capabilities of each consecutive platform.</p>
